# godot audio preview exposed module
 A novice dev's attempt at exposing godot's audio preview feature to a node usable by GDscript
 To be honest, I only have half an idea of what I am doing. If it works, it works.
 I am working on this becouse existing projects doing the same is not yet at this time updated for godot 4.
